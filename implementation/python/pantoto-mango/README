The Pantoto project was conceptualized to out perform existing CMS paradigms
by assuming a community based approach - allowing users to create a web 
presence and connect with their communities seamlessly and effortlessly. 
The power of Pantoto lies in its architecture that makes it an easy and natural 
tool to create collaborative communities.

The project benefits small and medium enterprises and NGOs to manage their
content without the apprehension of engaging with expensive technical support.

This hosted project space references the latest development in Pantoto 
implementations, the previous Java version being phased out. Built on Django,
interfacing with MongoDB over the Mango framework, Pantoto is likely to be 
highly extensible and has much learning to offer to contributors aside of the
benefits to users.

The core Pantoto team currently works out of Servelots, Bangalore, India.
