User specific interaction
--------------------------

All user interface functions should be invoked with respect
to a user.  Currently, the update and the list functions do
this, but not list-all.  List-all should be available to a
special user called admin.  


Work flow actions should include user
-------------------------------------

There is no notion of a user invoking actively (via a send)
or passively (via a get) an action.  The next-state function
information should also be user specific and must carry user
as the first parameter.


Allow fields and pagelets to be created as part of hooks
--------------------------------------------------------

Currently, pagelets and fields may be registered within
hooks, but they need to be  created in the initialization.


This is only because Scheme will let you create a top-level
binding only at the top level.  It's not a serious
limitation since the only reason we want to have top level
bindings is because it becomes easier to refer to fields via
Scheme identifiers.  There is no need to have a table of
field name keys that map to fields.  Ditto for pagelets.
