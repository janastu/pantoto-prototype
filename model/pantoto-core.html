<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="motivation-and-objective">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivation and objective</a></h2>
<p>We propose a model for pantoto core.  The motivation for
this exercise is to understand abstractly the essence of
Pantoto's design.  The model described here, however, is
self contained and independently developed.  While
selectively borrowing elements of Pantoto's architecture, it
is unencumbered by the compulsions of Pantoto's current
design.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="core-elements">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core Elements</a></h2>
<p>Core pantoto consists of three primary entities together
referred to as the <strong>system</strong>: users, fields and pagelets.
Users have state.  Fields have content.  Pagelets have
views.  The view depends on the user viewing the pagelet and
that user's state.  A user's view of a pagelet consists of a
subset of fields and their permissions, ie., whether they
are readable and/or writable.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example to ground some of the terminology
and further motivate the model.  The example is developed in
detail later in the document.  An examination process
consists of two users: the student and the teacher.  At any
given time, the student is in one of the following possible
states: ready to take the exam, writing the exam, finished
taking the exam.  The examination paper is a pagelet that
starts off with a view consisting of one field, the
question, visible to both the teacher and the student.  When
the student receives the examination paper, the view changes
to include the student's answer field.  This field is
writable by the student, readable-only by the teacher.  When
the student is done with the examination paper, the view
changes to make the answer field read-only for the student
as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="work-flow-driven-evolution-of-pagelet-views">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work flow driven evolution of pagelet views</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>workflow</strong> of the system specifies how the states of
the users evolve based on <strong>events</strong>.  Events are atomic and
instantaneous and cause the users' state to change.  E.g., a
student in ready state, upon receiving the exam question
paper from the teacher (a 'paper' event), begins writing the
answer, i.e, transitions to a 'writing' state.  Events could
be synchronised (as in a hand shake) or autonomous,
involving only a single user.  (These latter type of events
are often referred to as hidden transitions.)  We use
Milner's CCS equations to describe workflows as processes.</p>
<p>The <strong>process state</strong> of the system at any given instant
consists of the set of users and their states with respect
to the system workflow.  For example, the workflow in the
previous example proceeds through the following process
states:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(s_ready, t_ready)     --receive-paper--&gt;
(s_writing, t_waiting) --submit--&gt;
(s_waiting, t_grading) --grade--&gt;
(s_done, t_done)
</pre>
<p>The set of fields and their content define the <strong>content
state</strong> state of the system.  The <strong>view state</strong> of the
system at any instance is the set of pagelets and their
views.  Workflow events potentially effect changes in the
view state of the system.</p>
<p>Fields exist independent of pagelets, although they need to
be attached to a pagelet to be viewed.  A field may be
attached to multiple pagelets.  E.g., the question field may
be part of multiple exam papers delivered to multiple
students.</p>
<p>The <strong>trace</strong> of a system is sequence consists of a sequence
of triples indexed by event occurrences.  Each triple
consists of of the system's process state, its content state
and the view state immediately after the occurrence of the
event.</p>
<p>The specification of a Pantoto core application consists of
workflow specification along with rules on how the system's
views change when events occur.  At this time, we do not
have a formal way of specifying the rules.  Instead, we will
illustrate several examples of system traces.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="type-structure">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type structure</a></h1>
<p>Core pantoto has the following TYPES:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
User    : TYPE
State   : TYPE
Event   : TYPE
Content : TYPE     ;; type of the content of fields
Field   : TYPE
Pagelet : TYPE
Perm    : TYPE = {--, r-, -w, rw}
</pre>
<p>Content is the type of possible values in the content of
fields.  In the examples, we use primitive types like
booleans, strings, and numbers as part of Content.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dynamics">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dynamics</a></h1>
<p>The system is defined by the following three primary state
variables:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
users   : set[User]     ;; the set of users in the system
fields  : set[Field]    ;; the set of fields in the system
pagelets: set[Pagelet]  ;; the set of pagelets in the system
</pre>
<p>and the following secondary state variables</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
user-state    : users -&gt; State
field-content : fields -&gt; Content
pagelet-view  : pagelets -&gt; users -&gt; [fields -:&gt; Perm]
</pre>
<p>In pagelet-view, the -:&gt; indicates a partial function.  Each
user sees a subset of the fields and their permissions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="examples">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples:</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="exam-paper-and-grading">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exam paper and grading</a></h2>
<p>There are two users s and t (student and teacher) and one
exam paper pagelet p, which starts off with one field q, the
question.  When the student receives the paper, it has an
answer field a added to it.  Finally, when the student
submits the paper to the teacher, p acquires a grade field,
which is filled and returned to the student.  At each stage
the workflow specifies the users, fields, pagelets and their
views.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
s_ready     = ?paper . s_writing    ;; receives paper, starts writing.
s_writing   = !submit . s_waiting   ;; submits paper, waiting for grade.
s_waiting   = ?grade . s_done       ;; receives grade, done.

t_setting   = !paper . t_waiting    ;; hands over paper, waiting.
t_waiting   = ?submit . t_grading   ;; receives paper, grading
t_grading   = !grade . t_done       ;; hands over grade, done.


s_ready | t_ready
</pre>
<p>The system starts off with a ready (but nervous) student and
a teacher ready with the question.</p>
<p>We now trace the evolution of the system's state variables,
which change state at each event.  The following state variables
are irrelevant to the discussion below and have therefore
been omitted (although a complete description must include
their values).</p>
<div class="section" id="initial-state-of-the-system">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">4.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial state of the system:</a></h3>
<pre class="literal-block">
users = {s, t}   ;; unchanged over the entire workflow.
fields = {q}
pagelets = {p}   ;; unchanged over the entire workflow.

pagelet-view(p)   = {t : {q : rw}}
</pre>
<p>The teacher is still setting the question paper.  The
student can't see the question paper at all.  The pagelet's
view does not have a mapping for user <span class="code-inline">student</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="after-student-receives-the-examination-paper-paper-event">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">4.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After student receives the examination  paper (paper event):</a></h3>

pagelet-view(p)   =
 {s : {q : r-, a : rw},
  t : {q : r-, a : --}}
</pre>
<p>The answer is visible (and writable) only to the student.
The teacher knows that there is a field called answer, but
can't see it.  (A different pagelet-view could allow him to
view the answer as the student is writing it.  Yet another
pagelet-view could render the field answer completely
invisible to the teacher. )</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="after-the-student-submits-the-paper-submit-event">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">4.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the student submits the paper (submit event):</a></h3>
<pre class="literal-block">
fields = {q, a, g}
pagelet-view(p)   =
 {s : {q : r-, a : r-},
  t : {q : r-, a : r-, g: rw}}
</pre>
<p>The answer field of the student is no longer writable by the
student.  The answer field is now visible but not writable
by the teacher.  A grade field is added, but only the
teacher can see and manipulate it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="after-the-paper-is-graded-grade-event">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">4.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the paper is graded  (grade event):</a></h3>

  {s : {q : r-, a : r-, g: r-},
   t : {q : r-, a : r-, g: r-}}
</pre>
<p>The grade once given is no longer editable, even by the teacher.</p>
<p>The pagelet evolution could have been defined in the more
&quot;traditional&quot; way, where all three fields of the pagelet are
defined and visible from the beginning, but are selectively
writable by the student or the teacher.  We illustrate this
below.  Note that the workflow (control) specification is
the same as before.</p>
<p>Note that in the above simulation, we only tracked the
changes in the view of the system: its users, fields,
pagelets and the pagelet views.  We did not need keep track
of the contents of the fields.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="info-pages-public-views-and-private-annotations">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Info pages: public views and private annotations</a></h2>
<p>This example simulates an office intranet, with two users A
and B.  The set of pagelets consists of one pagelet, which
is A's info page.  It has 3 fields: his name, email, and
mobile.  A has rw access to each of these fields.  Other
intranet users have read access to these fields.  An
external user C only knows about the name and
email; she has no knowledge of the field called mobile.</p>
<p>At the next event, B privately annotates A's info page.  His
annotation is not visible to anyone else.</p>
<p>The workflow dynamics of the info pages system is described
by the following equation.</p>

b = annotate . b

<div class="section" id="discussion">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion</a></h1>
<p>It is tempting to draw an analogy between file permissions
in a file system and field permissions in Pantoto core.
Unlike in a file system, however, a user in Pantoto core is
not endowed with read-write permissions on fields per se.
Nor does the user 'own' a field or a pagelet.  Similarly,
the concept of a user having a permission to add or delete a
field from a pagelet is not supported in this model.
Rather, a user's view of a pagelet, and thereby the
read-write privileges on fields, is derived from that user's
role and his state in a particular workflow.  In a real
application, any given user is associated with multiple
workflows.  Since fields are shared, a user may, at a given
time, have different permissions on the same field, each set
of permissions tied to a different workflow.  In the model
described here, we do not invoke the concept of a role; that
will be addressed in an extended model later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bells-and-whistles">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bells and Whistles</a></h1>
<p>The system could support a predefined pagelet called
PAGELETS which shows, for each user, pagelets that that user
is allowed to see and modify.  For the sake of simplicity,
this special pagelet has not been included in the examples.</p>
